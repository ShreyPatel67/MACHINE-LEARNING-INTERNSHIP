Decision Tree in Machine Learning: A Complete Guide
🚀 A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It breaks down data into smaller subsets based on conditions, making decisions similar to how a human would.

🌳 Key Components of a Decision Tree
1️⃣ Root Node → The starting point that represents the entire dataset.
2️⃣ Decision Nodes → Intermediate nodes where the data gets split.
3️⃣ Branches → Connects nodes and represents possible decisions.
4️⃣ Leaf Nodes → The final decision or output (e.g., a class label).

📌 Example: Suppose we want to classify a patient’s drug type based on age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. The decision tree will help determine the best drug by evaluating these factors.

📌 Where is a Decision Tree Used?
Decision Trees have applications in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and AI-driven decision-making.

🏥 Healthcare
✔ Disease Diagnosis – Helps diagnose diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer based on symptoms.
✔ Drug Prescription – Determines the best medication for a patient based on medical data.
✔ Medical Chatbots – AI-based assistants suggest treatments based on patient input.

💰 Finance
✔ Credit Risk Analysis – Predicts whether a person will default on a loan.
✔ Fraud Detection – Identifies unusual transactions that might be fraudulent.
✔ Stock Market Prediction – Helps investors decide which stocks to buy or sell.

📊 Marketing & Sales
✔ Customer Segmentation – Groups customers based on age, spending habits, and location.
✔ Lead Scoring – Predicts which customers are likely to convert into buyers.
✔ Ad Targeting – Determines the best audience for specific advertisements.
